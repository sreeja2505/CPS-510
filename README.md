# MEDICAL CLINIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (DBMS) CPS 510

For this project, our team has decided to design and implement a generalizable ease-of-use, and practical Medical Clinic information system with an SQL database at its heart. It employs various data points for its users to fill in with relevant data, and more if needed. The following proposal illustrates our plan and layout for the database, as well as explanations for how each component might work in the final product.

These are the following users of the database:

     (a) Doctor user: This user is used to enter the medical history of each patient. Also, prints the medical history of the patient (if required).
Applications can be used-
Enter into the doctor window by using his username and password.
Enter the patient’s record on the day of the visit.
Treats the patients and makes sure he will enter the medical record of each patient.

     (b) Nurse user: This user is used to enter the latest medical record like BP, height and weight on the day of the visit to the doctor.
Applications can be used-
Checks the patient’s weight, height and BP
Enter the values in their respective window.

     (c) Receptionist user: This user is used to enter the details of the patient/ and follow up with    the details of the old user.
Applications can be used-
Enter the patient’s details.(new user)
Enter the details of the patient (old user), in case if the patient does not have the health card then there will be a consultation fee.
Books an appointment for the doctor.


This database and application are designed for ease of collecting data for a clinic and its users. Our plan for the final application is to create a GUI for ease-of-use operation for the users of this application, but it will also allow for console interaction to allow flexibility with other systems or scripts if needed.

This document outlined our plan and path towards implementation of the system, as well as the general design of the data being stored. Our plan for this system is to provide an easily generalizable Medical Clinic system that allows for rapid integration with existing clinics and their respective unique structures.Our plan is to further specify the workings and implementation of this project going forward.
